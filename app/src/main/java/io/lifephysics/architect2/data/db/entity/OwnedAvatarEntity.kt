/**
 * Represents a single avatar ownership record.
 *
 * Each row means: "the user with [userId] owns the avatar with [avatarId]".
 * The composite primary key (userId + avatarId) ensures a user cannot own
 * the same avatar twice.
 *
 * This table is designed to scale to thousands of avatars and multiple users
 * without any schema changes. Adding new avatars requires no migration —
 * new rows are simply inserted on purchase.
 *
 * Avatar ID 1 is inserted automatically when a new user is created,
 * as it is the free starter avatar.
